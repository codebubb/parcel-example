# Parcel Example
A quick look at using Parcel to build a static site that uses Sass and TypeScript for development.

## Running the Example
Once you've cloned the project, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Then you can either run the Parcel web server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Or build the files for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The `build` script will produce a folder called `dist` which will have the content ready for hosting.
